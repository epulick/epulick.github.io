I'm a 5th year PhD Student in Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, specifically in the Decision Science and Operations Research degree track. I am advised by Dr. Yonatan Mintz. I anticipate graduating in spring 2026 and will be looking for full-time roles in data science and analytics.

My graduate research focuses on sequential decision making problems in human-facing contexts like psychology and healthcare. Much of my recent work has dealt specifically with the use of operations research tools to improve treatment for individuals with substance use disorders. Prior to UW-Madison, I received my BSE and MSE in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan, focused primarily on combustion and energy systems. I also spent 5 years as a systems/software engineer at Bosch where I worked on brake system architectures for autonomous vehicles.
